* My front-end is not finished, i was unfortunately sick so i didn't really have some time to work on it, still learning on React and i hope i will learn a lot by the experience :)

# My application UI/UX

* I have finded some nice UI Design ideas but first i would like to make sure my first Full-Stack app work correctly with basic CSS and then after make the changes at the end, i have only done some basic stuff on my code and im quite struggling a bit on doing it since it changes from the Netflix App, so i hope i will find some time to finish it !

# UI Design 

* By searching some UI, ive founded one that i really like:

* So my "big goal" is to reproduce this design fondamentals and then modify it and adapt it how i like it by changing colors/fonts and some other stuffs to make it even nice.
